# Introduction to R_Exercises

## Exercise 16

![Exercise 16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdetoro91/exploratory-exercises1/main/16.png)

-   Create a vector called "x":

```{r}
x <- c(36, 28, 19, 22, 27, 28, 30, 31, 38, 46, 40, 29, 21, 28, 39, 46, 43, 27, 30, 54)
```

-   Prints the vector size:

```{r}
print(length(x))
```

-   AVG w/out mean function:

```{r}
m <- sum(x)/length(x)
print(m)
```

-   Variance w/out variance function:

```{r}
v <- (1/(length(x)-1))*sum((x-m)**2)
print(v)
```

```{r}
var(x)
```

> I have used the variance function to check that in the statement of the exercise there is an error in the result. CQD

-   Standard Deviation using the function:

```{r}
sd <- sd(x)
print(sd)
```

-   Median w/out median function:

We need sort the sample, ask for the lenght to know if it is odd or even, and at the end calculate the median

```{r}
x_sort <- sort(x)

if(length(x)%%2 == 0){
  x1 <- x_sort[((length(x)+1)/2)-.5]
  x2 <- x_sort[((length(x)+1)/2)+.5]
  med <- (x1+x2)/2
}else{
  med <- x_sort[(length(x)+1)/2]
}

print(med)
```

-   Calculate the mode:

```{r}
uniqv <- unique(x)

# I need to know the position of the first appearance of each element in order to make a count. 
match <- match(x, uniqv)

# Now I count the number of occurrences of each value, even though they are positions, it doesn't matter, because they refer to a unique element due to the use of uniqv
tab <- tabulate(match)

# Now I want to know what is the maximum of the entire vector
pos <- which.max(tab)

# The previous number tells me the position of the element in the initial vector, so I have to paint the value of that element in its first occurrence
print(uniqv[pos])
```

## Exercise 23

![Exercise 23](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdetoro91/exploratory-exercises1/main/23.png)

```{r}
quicksort <- function (v){
  if(length(v)==0){
    print("Empty array")
    close()
  }else{
    pivots <- v[match(v[1], v)]
    lesser <- v[which(as.vector(v) < v[1])]
    greatter <- v[which(as.vector(v) > v[1])]
    result <- c(sort(lesser), sort(pivots), sort(greatter))
    return(result)
  }
}
```

Try the function:

```{r}
set.seed(100)
quicksort(sample(1:100, 10))
```


## Exercise 24

![Exercise 24](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdetoro91/exploratory-exercises1/main/24.png)

-   Seed in 2017:

```{r}
set.seed(2017)
```
